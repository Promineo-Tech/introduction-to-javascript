   Use a while loop to increment count by 2 on each repetition of the block of code. 
   Run the code block of your while loop until count is 8.

   Challenge 3
   Use an if statement to check if num is greater than 100. 
   If num is greater than 100, reassign the value of final to null. 
   Otherwise, set final to be two times the value of num.
